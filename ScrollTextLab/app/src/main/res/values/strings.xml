Rockument’s first commercial documentary, Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties, garnered critical acclaim and published reviews that referred to it as “An unflinching, nonjudgmental chronicle” (Wired), “Inspires then and now connections, fulfilling any historical work’s highest calling” (S.F. Examiner), “Truly greater than the sum of its parts” (N.Y. Post).\n\n
While many music services focus on hits, contemporary music, live shows, etc., Rockument dives deep into back catalogs to unearth the gems from the past and present them in their proper context. Rockument shows include overlooked album cuts and rare songs, and focus on musical and cultural influences that shaped the history of rock music, with historical accounts and sources. The goal is to provide a consistent source of high-quality history-based entertainment for rock music collectors and avid\n\n fans.</string>
